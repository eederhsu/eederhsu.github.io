      <description>Our MovieWatson is a light movie recommendation system for each person. Most of the movie recommendation systems need the registration of their members. In addition, these recommendation systems will recommend the movie by the historical information of this user. These are lack of flexibility. Therefore, MovieWatson used instant rating, and the users can also receive the recommendation by their interests at the moment. Meanwhile, MovieWatson does not need users to register as a member, it saves complex registration procedures.</description>

Collecting 20 training samples, the authors have used FFT to analyze the spectra of two different speakers and found several features in it, such as the number of the peaks that are larger than the mean amplitude. After establishing five criteria, the researchers successfully identified speakers from 10 input test data.</description>
